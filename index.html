          <h3>Human-Computer Interaction and Web Design(Spring 2018)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li class="list-majoritem">Project 1: Onboarding
                <ul>
                  <li>You will create a compelling single-page design that features a sign-up
                    process to get new users to join some type of project, such as an email list,
                    a software beta test, or an open-source community. Focus on designing for an
                    effortless, engaging entry of personal information; and friendly, frictionless
                    client-side tests and alerts for malformed, missing, or incomplete information.
                    The goal of this project is to experiment with patterns of interaction that persuade
                    someone to sign up for whatever it is you’re offering, which is not at
                    all an easy task.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="list-majoritem">Project Two: Web-Portal Redesign
                <ul>
                  <li>Some of the very worst designed websites you’ll come across are for banking,
                    credit card payment, HR portals, and other non-optional websites for certain classes
                    of customers or workers. Self-selected teams of 3-4 students will redesign the MyIIT
                    login page, the welcome page/tab, and all necessary steps for achieving a specific
                    student-user task (some examples: generating a class schedule, dropping a class,
                    paying a tuition bill, removing a registration hold, or any other task that students
                    complete through MyIIT). Your redesigned portal should be designed and developed according
                    to sound principles of human-computer interaction, user experience,
                    and emotional design.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="list-majoritem">Project Three: User-Tested, Revised Web Portal
                <ul>
                  <li> The final project of the course asks you to subject your group’s Web Portal
                    Redesign project to a series of low-stakes user tests, and to suggest improvements
                    to the Web Portal Redesign project based on what you learn through your user tests.
                    You should structure your tests around the guidance in Chapter 9 of Krug’s book.

                    form available <a href="http://www.sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html">at Krug’s website</a>. However, your script must be modified to match your
                    specific project and tasks, obviously.</li>
