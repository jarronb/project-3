      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jarron Bailey and I am a 3rd year Information Technology &amp;
          Management major at Illinois Institute of Technology. I plan on specialzing
          either Web Design and Application Development or Software Development. At Illinois
          Tech I'm involed in the Nation Society of Black Engineers(NSBE) which is full of talented
          minds that is geared to help me grow professional skills as well as people skills. I am
          native to the southside Chicago area, but ultimatley moved to the south suburb
          Matteson to complete highschool career. I had an unexpected tragedy at the age of
          thirthteen, I lost my mother to Cancer. Although I believe for that single
          moment to be the lowest point in my life, I wholeheartedly believe that it
          forged me into an ambitious, progressive, self-learning individual that has been continuously
          crushing self goals.

      <h2>Aspirations</h2>
        <p>
          As an developer, I plan to develop mobile first, sematically driven web pages/apps.
          I tend to believe that as a developer I can turn ideas(something abstract) into something tangible.
          Rather I'm putting my own ideas into fluoration or consumer, I want to have the ability to create
          meaningful entities for the consumer market. Why not start here at home, in Chicago:
